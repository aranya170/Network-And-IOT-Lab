# Lab 01: Blink LED - Your First IoT Project

## Objective
Learn the basics of microcontroller programming by controlling an LED using Arduino/ESP32. This is the "Hello World" of IoT and embedded systems.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand basic microcontroller pin configuration
- Learn digital output control
- Understand GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins
- Introduction to Arduino IDE and code structure
- Learn basic timing functions

## Required Components
- Arduino Uno / ESP32 DevKit
- LED (any color)
- 220Ω Resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable for programming

## Theory

### What is an LED?
A Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when current flows through it. LEDs have polarity - the longer leg is positive (anode) and shorter leg is negative (cathode).

### GPIO Pins
GPIO pins can be configured as either input or output. For blinking an LED, we configure a pin as OUTPUT to control voltage levels (HIGH = 3.3V/5V, LOW = 0V).

### Arduino Code Structure
Every Arduino sketch has two main functions:
- `setup()` - Runs once when the program starts
- `loop()` - Runs repeatedly after setup()

## Circuit Diagram

```
Arduino/ESP32          Resistor       LED
    Pin 13 ----------- 220Ω -------- Anode(+)
    GND ------------------------------ Cathode(-)
```

**Note:** Always use a current-limiting resistor with LEDs to prevent damage.

## Circuit Connection Steps

1. **Insert LED** into breadboard
   - Long leg (anode) in one row
   - Short leg (cathode) in another row

2. **Connect Resistor**
   - One end to LED anode row
   - Other end to a new row

3. **Connect Jumper Wires**
   - Digital pin 13 to resistor (connected to LED anode)
   - GND pin to LED cathode

4. **Connect USB** cable from Arduino to computer

## Code Implementation

### Basic Blink Code (Arduino/ESP32)

```cpp
// Pin definition
const int LED_PIN = 13;  // Built-in LED on most Arduino boards
// For ESP32, use GPIO 2: const int LED_PIN = 2;

void setup() {
  // Initialize the LED pin as output
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Turn LED ON
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second (1000 milliseconds)
  
  // Turn LED OFF
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  delay(1000);  // Wait for 1 second
}
```

### Code Explanation

- **`const int LED_PIN = 13;`** - Defines a constant for pin number
- **`pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);`** - Configures pin 13 as output
- **`digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);`** - Sends 5V to pin (LED ON)
- **`digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);`** - Sends 0V to pin (LED OFF)
- **`delay(1000);`** - Pauses program for 1000ms (1 second)

## Upload and Test

### Steps to Upload Code

1. **Open Arduino IDE**
2. **Select Board**
   - Tools → Board → Arduino Uno (or your board)
   - For ESP32: Tools → Board → ESP32 Dev Module
3. **Select Port**
   - Tools → Port → COM3 (or your port)
4. **Copy and paste the code**
5. **Click Upload button** (→ icon)
6. **Observe** - LED should blink every second

## Expected Output
The LED will turn ON for 1 second, then OFF for 1 second, repeating continuously.

## Experiments and Modifications

### Experiment 1: Change Blink Speed
Modify delay values to change blink speed:
```cpp
digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
delay(250);  // LED ON for 0.25 seconds
digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
delay(250);  // LED OFF for 0.25 seconds
```

### Experiment 2: SOS Pattern (Morse Code)
```cpp
void loop() {
  // S - three short blinks
  for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
    delay(200);
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
    delay(200);
  }
  
  delay(400);  // Pause between letters
  
  // O - three long blinks
  for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
    delay(600);
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
    delay(200);
  }
  
  delay(400);  // Pause between letters
  
  // S - three short blinks
  for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
    delay(200);
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
    delay(200);
  }
  
  delay(2000);  // Wait before repeating SOS
}
```

### Experiment 3: Multiple LEDs
Connect 3 LEDs to pins 11, 12, 13:
```cpp
const int LED1 = 11;
const int LED2 = 12;
const int LED3 = 13;

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED3, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Sequential blinking
  digitalWrite(LED1, HIGH);
  delay(300);
  digitalWrite(LED1, LOW);
  
  digitalWrite(LED2, HIGH);
  delay(300);
  digitalWrite(LED2, LOW);
  
  digitalWrite(LED3, HIGH);
  delay(300);
  digitalWrite(LED3, LOW);
}
```

### Experiment 4: Breathing Effect (PWM)
```cpp
const int LED_PIN = 9;  // Must use PWM-capable pin

void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Fade in
  for(int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
    analogWrite(LED_PIN, brightness);
    delay(5);
  }
  
  // Fade out
  for(int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
    analogWrite(LED_PIN, brightness);
    delay(5);
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| LED doesn't light up | LED connected backwards | Reverse LED polarity |
| LED very dim | Wrong resistor value | Use 220Ω resistor |
| Upload error | Wrong port selected | Check Tools → Port |
| Board not detected | Driver not installed | Install CH340/CP2102 driver |
| LED stays on/off | Code not uploaded | Re-upload code |

## Key Concepts Review

1. **Digital Output** - Sends HIGH (5V) or LOW (0V) signals
2. **pinMode()** - Configures pin as INPUT or OUTPUT
3. **digitalWrite()** - Sets pin to HIGH or LOW
4. **delay()** - Pauses program execution
5. **Resistor** - Limits current to protect LED

## Challenge Questions

1. How would you make LED blink 5 times then pause for 3 seconds?
2. What happens if you remove the resistor?
3. How can you calculate the correct resistor value for different LEDs?
4. What is PWM and how does it create a breathing effect?
5. Can you create a traffic light sequence with 3 LEDs?

## Next Steps
In the next lab, you will learn to connect your ESP32 to WiFi and control the LED through a website, taking your first step into true IoT development!
