Bipolar Stepper Motor Control with Arduino (A4988 Driver)
This tutorial guides you through controlling a bipolar stepper motor with pins A+, A-, B+, B- using an Arduino Uno and an A4988 stepper driver in the Circuit Designer IDE.

1. Components Needed

Arduino Uno
Bipolar stepper motor (e.g., NEMA 17) with 4 wires:
A+, A− (Coil A)
B+, B− (Coil B)

A4988 stepper motor driver
External motor power supply (e.g., 12V for NEMA 17)
Breadboard & jumper wires
100 µF electrolytic capacitor

2. Set Up the Circuit in Circuit Designer IDE
   Create a New Project

Open Circuit Designer IDE and create a new project for your circuit.

Add Components
From the component library in Circuit Designer IDE, add the following:

Arduino Uno
Bipolar stepper motor (ensure it has A+, A-, B+, B- pins, e.g., NEMA 17)
A4988 stepper motor driver
Power supply (set to 12V for motor)
Breadboard (optional for organization)
Jumper wires
100 µF electrolytic capacitor

Wire the Circuit
Connect the components as follows:
Motor to A4988

Motor Pin
A4988 Pin

A+
1A

A−
1B

B+
2A

B−
2B

A4988 to Arduino

A4988 Pin
Arduino Pin / Connection

VMOT
Motor power + (e.g., 12V)

GND (VMOT)
Motor power GND

VDD
Arduino 5V

GND (VDD)
Arduino GND

STEP
Pin 3

DIR
Pin 4

EN (optional)
Arduino GND (always on)

Always connect the 100 µF capacitor across VMOT and GND (close to the driver) to protect against voltage spikes.

3. Arduino Code — Basic Rotation
   In Circuit Designer IDE, open the code editor for the Arduino Uno and paste the following code:
   #define dirPin 4
   #define stepPin 3
   #define stepsPerRevolution 200 // Typical NEMA 17 value

void setup() {
pinMode(stepPin, OUTPUT);
pinMode(dirPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
// Clockwise
digitalWrite(dirPin, HIGH);
for (int i = 0; i < stepsPerRevolution; i++) {
digitalWrite(stepPin, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(800);
digitalWrite(stepPin, LOW);
delayMicroseconds(800);
}
delay(1000);

// Counterclockwise
digitalWrite(dirPin, LOW);
for (int i = 0; i < stepsPerRevolution; i++) {
digitalWrite(stepPin, HIGH);
delayMicroseconds(800);
digitalWrite(stepPin, LOW);
delayMicroseconds(800);
}
delay(1000);
}

4. Running the Simulation

Connect the motor to the A4988 as shown in the Motor to A4988 table.
Connect the A4988 to the Arduino and power supply in Circuit Designer IDE.
Attach the 100 µF capacitor between VMOT and GND on the A4988.
Upload the Arduino code in the Circuit Designer IDE code editor.
Power the motor using the external power supply (not from Arduino’s 5V pin).
Run the simulation in Circuit Designer IDE to watch the motor rotate forward, then backward.

5. Notes

If the motor vibrates but doesn’t rotate, swap either A+ ↔ A− or B+ ↔ B− in the circuit.
Change delayMicroseconds(800) to adjust speed — smaller delay = faster speed.
Adjust stepsPerRevolution according to your motor's datasheet.
For smoother motion, enable microstepping by wiring MS1, MS2, MS3 pins on the A4988 (consult the driver’s documentation).
Verify all connections in Circuit Designer IDE’s schematic view to ensure accuracy.

Troubleshooting

Motor Not Moving: Check all connections, ensure the external power supply is active, and confirm the correct pin assignments in the code.
Simulation Errors: Ensure the Circuit Designer IDE project is properly configured with the correct components and no loose connections.
Incorrect Rotation: Verify the motor coil connections (A+, A-, B+, B-) match the A4988 pinout.

Next Steps

Add Sensors: Integrate a sensor (e.g., limit switch) to control motor movement.
Use Libraries: Explore the AccelStepper library for advanced motor control.
Save and Share: Export your Circuit Designer IDE project and share it for collaboration.

You have successfully controlled a bipolar stepper motor with Arduino using the A4988 driver in Circuit Designer IDE!
