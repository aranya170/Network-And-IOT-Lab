# Arduino Integration with Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) Sensor
This guide explains how to integrate the Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) sensor with an Arduino board. The documentation is designed for junior students and is easy to understand.
## Sensor Name and Type
* Name: Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR)
* Type: Analog Pressure Sensor
### Required Library
* No additional libraries are needed for basic FSR functionality. The sensor communicates directly with the Arduino using analog input.
## Purpose
* The FSR sensor detects force applied to its surface. You can use this sensor to:
* Measure pressure or force.
* Build touch-sensitive devices.
* Create interactive projects such as musical instruments or robotic hands.
## Hardware Details
* Arduino Board: Any model (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega).
* FSR Sensor Module.
* 10kΩ Resistor (for voltage divider circuit).
* Connecting Wires: 4 jumper wires (Male-to-Female).
* Power Source: USB cable to power the Arduino.
## Code with Explanation
Here’s a simple Arduino program to read data from the FSR sensor:
```bash
const int fsrPin = A0; // Pin connected to the FSR sensor

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("FSR Sensor Ready");
}

void loop() {
  int fsrValue = analogRead(fsrPin); // Read the analog value from the FSR

  Serial.print("Force Reading: ");
  Serial.println(fsrValue);

  delay(500); // Wait for 0.5 seconds before reading again
}
```

## Code Explanation:
* Define Pin: Specifies the pin where the FSR sensor is connected.
* Initialize Serial Communication: Sets up the Serial Monitor to display the readings.
* Read Data: Captures the analog reading from the FSR sensor.
* Print Data: Displays the sensor values on the Serial Monitor.
## Troubleshooting Tips
* No Readings: Ensure the connections are correct and the sensor is pressed firmly.
* Incorrect Values: Verify the resistor value (10kΩ) in the voltage divider circuit.
* Fluctuating Readings: Ensure a stable power supply and check for loose wires.
* Sensor Sensitivity: The FSR is not highly precise and is better suited for relative measurements.



Diagram
Below is a block diagram explaining the system:

|  Arduino Board          |        Force Sensitive Resistor        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
|         5V              |               One Pin                  |
|         GND             |               Other Pin (via Resistor) |
|         Analog Pin      |               A0                       |

This simple setup ensures the sensor communicates with the Arduino to measure force or pressure.

Now you’re ready to use the Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) sensor with Arduino! Enjoy building amazing pressure-based projects!
