# Concept of Sensors & Motor Control in Arduino
## Sensors in Arduino
A sensor is a device that detects changes in the environment (e.g., temperature, distance, motion) and converts it into an electrical signal that Arduino can read.

### Types of Sensors & How They Work

* Digital Sensors (Give ON/OFF signals)
  * Motion Sensor (PIR) → Detects movement (outputs HIGH or LOW).
  * Limit Switch → Detects when something reaches a position.
* Analog Sensors (Give variable readings)
  * Temperature Sensor (LM35) → Outputs voltage based on temperature.
  * Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) → Measures distance using sound waves.
  * Potentiometer → Changes resistance based on knob rotation.





## Motor Control in Arduino
A motor is an actuator that converts electrical energy into mechanical motion.

### Types of Motors & How They Work

* DC Motor (Rotates in one direction, controlled via PWM).
* Servo Motor (Rotates to a specific angle, controlled via signals).
* Stepper Motor (Moves in precise steps, controlled via pulses).
